Learning is a continuous journey of discovery, where we actively seek out new knowledge, skills, and perspectives to adapt and grow. It is not just about memorizing facts, but about developing the ability to connect ideas, solve complex problems, and deepen our understanding of the world around us. This process requires curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to step outside our comfort zone, embracing mistakes as valuable feedback that fuels our intellectual and personal evolution.
